### ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

I'm Jenny from Munich, Germany the city where the :beer: runs and the people actually wear Lederhosen every now and then.
I worked as a **graphic designer** before I started my career on the developers side of the universe. 
Well that didn't cover the Lederhosen, though I did design a few beer labels for one or the other televison show. 
For the past decade, I am an **Adobe Photoshop lover** & friend of the pixel (as well as all those nice Adobe programs out there) 
and mostly put my head and hands on designing items like film and televison props which can be anything like 
:pill: :lotion_bottle: :newspaper: :iphone: :tickets: :unicorn: and many more.

I am good at prototyping and have experience with UX/UI Skills such as **Adobe XD** and **ProtoPie** as well as some **Figma**. 

I hope to combine my design skills with everything that **Coding Bootcamp Europe** will teach me. 
Despite the fact, that I am quite fascinated by the backend, my skills seem to match better with the frontend.
