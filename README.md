### ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

I'm Jenny from Munich, Germany the city where the :beer: runs and the people actually wear Lederhosen every now and then.
I worked as a **graphic designer** before I started my career on the developers side of the universe. 
Well that didn't cover the Lederhosen, though I did design a few beer labels for one or the other televison show. 
For the past decade, I am an **Adobe Photoshop lover** & friend of the pixel (and all those nice Adobe programs out there) 
and mostly put my head and hands on designing items like film and televison props which can be anything like 
:pill: :lotion_bottle: :newspaper: :iphone: :tickets: :unicorn: and many more.

I am also good a prototyping as my work is basically just that when it comes to websites or apps used for television - 
the usually don't need to work at all but just look like they do.
Therefore I have UX/UI Skills with **Adobe XD** and **ProtoPie** and have seen some **Figma**. 

I work for various german television shows und films but nobody told me, that when workin in the film industry, you are working with only extroverts which can be hard if you 
are a bit BAZINGA sometimes. 
Also, all my designs have a very short life expectancy as they are mostly seen on screen for no longer than 5 seconds :alarm_clock::skull_and_crossbones:. 

So I started some **basic software engineering** along with some **python** in my free time (which is rare with 3 little kids at home) 
just because I was wondering if I could program something myself instead of just making things look good. 

And I liked it. It's not always easy but I like the way people are comitted to their projects and wish to participate myself. 
I think there is so much need for good software and I wonder how people can use software every day and have no clue about how it's done. 
I want to learn, I want to explore and I want to grow on my new journey. 

I hope to combine my design skills with everything that **Coding Bootcamp Europe** will teach me. 
Despite I am quite fascinated by the backend, my skills thend to be better of with the frontend for now.
